        <p>Recently, I was working on an app and I needed to get some data over an API. Everything was working according to plan until I wanted to show images that I was getting from the API, remote urls and boom, shit was falling apart. What was crazy to me was that a few were loading.</p>

<p>I didn’t get what the fuck was going on. I poured over my code, looking for some semblance of an error, maybe a typo that must be hiding in plain sight, nothing. I logged out the url I was getting from the API and there it was, staring me in the face.</p>

<p>I kept asking myself, “What the fuck is happening”?  So I set it aside and said I was gonna come back to it (I was secretly hoping that it would fix itself, you know how JavaScript acts times, lol). A week later, still wasn’t working, so I decided its time to take this motherfucker by the balls.</p>

<p>I googled this issue and in a thread somewhere on Github, I saw that Images can only be loaded if they are secure i.e HTTPS. Okay, thats cool but I can’t change the images from the API to serve over HTTPS, I needed something else, another way, NOW!</p>

<p>Then I came across something in apple called <strong>ATS (Application Transport Security)</strong> which is a baked in security measure. It protects your app from loading insecure data. I totally get that but for this scenario, I needed to override that so I dug deeper and found out how to do it, I had to change my info.plist and add exceptions for my API.</p>

<p>(Please don’t get me started on the XML format of the info.plist, I was shook, JSON for the win)</p>

<p>You can do it like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;NSAppTransportSecurity&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
  &lt;key&gt;NSExceptionDomains&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;example.com&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
      &lt;!--Include to allow subdomains--&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;NSIncludesSubdomains&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;true/&gt;
      &lt;!--Include to allow HTTP requests--&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this wasn’t enough for my scenario. The images I wanted to load were not particularly prefixed with my API’s domain name, so they weren’t all loading up.  I did something I’m not proud of, if you know a better way, please let me know (<strong>cries in shame</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;NSAppTransportSecurity&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
  &lt;key&gt;NSAllowsArbitraryLoads&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I’m happy to announce that all the images show up.</p>
