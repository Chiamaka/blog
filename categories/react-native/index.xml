      <description>So some time back I was roaming on the FB react-native community (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know that, click here) and I saw someone asking if there was a component like this and he posted up a photo of what he needed. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if there was one but I had the idea that maybe I could build one.
So hear me out.
I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that maybe, just maybe, someone would be willing to work on this with me to make it a really helpful component.</description>
