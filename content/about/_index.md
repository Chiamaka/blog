My name is Chiamaka Nwolisa. I'm a writer and a React Native developer. I'm
very skilled at Javascript which I totally love and i've made react native my
sole focus for the next one year. I'll be writing about react native on this
blog and also personal thoughts. You can sign up for my mailing list if you want
to be prompted whenever I post something on this site. (in the works, sorry)

Let's get rolling on this journey, hopefully delightful!
