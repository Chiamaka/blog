This is my first post on this blog. 

Instead of the legendary "hello world" sentence for doing something for the first time in coding, I'll call mine "Initial commit" after your first commit in git.

Today also signifies the day I was partially let go from my job, not fully. LOL, its complicated, I'll most likely blog about it later.

Anyways, this is the first post on this blog and hopefully more to come.
