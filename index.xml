      <description>I had a design I wanted to replicate and the button in this design is a round button and it has an icon in it.
Here is a snapshot
I immediately set out to accomplish the task. In my head, it was going to take less than 10 minutes. Ooh was I wrong. It took me the whole day to figure out.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the process be less painful for you and for my future self (I tend to forget alot.</description>

      <description>This is my first post on this blog.
Instead of the legendary &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; sentence for doing something for the first time in coding, I&amp;rsquo;ll call mine &amp;ldquo;Initial commit&amp;rdquo; after your first commit in git.
Today also signifies the day I was partially let go from my job, not fully. LOL, its complicated, I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely blog about it later.
Anyways, this is the first post on this blog and hopefully more to come.</description>
